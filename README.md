# Bitcoin-Miner
A distributed software which mines coins with k leading zeroes

Developed a system which mines bitcoins in a distributed environment. Coins are generated with leading zeroes using the sha256 hashing algorithm. 
The supervisor connects with other machines and generates coins at a much higher speed.

Made use of Elixir to generate the coins and to set up the supervisorâ€“worker model.
